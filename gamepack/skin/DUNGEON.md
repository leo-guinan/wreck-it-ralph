# Skin: RPG Dungeon

You progress through rooms. Each room is cleared when you:
1) meet acceptance criteria
2) defeat the room’s monsters (referee checks)

## Monsters (Referee Gates)
- Typecheck Troll: must pass typecheck
- Test Hydra: must pass test suite
- UI Specter: must provide screenshot proof when UI changes

## Loot (Memory & Patterns)
When you discover a reusable pattern, add it to MEMORY.md under "Loot".
