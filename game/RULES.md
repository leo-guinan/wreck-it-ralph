# Rules (Invariants)

1) One quest per turn. No “while you’re here”.
2) Must not introduce new failing tests/typecheck errors.
3) Prefer smallest diff that satisfies acceptance criteria.
4) If UI is involved, produce a screenshot proof when requested by the quest.
5) Never change unrelated files unless needed to satisfy typecheck/tests for the quest.
