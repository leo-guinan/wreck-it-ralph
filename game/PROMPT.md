# Game Turn Instructions (Ship Small Features)

You are playing a turn-based coding game.

## Current Quest
- ID: {{QUEST_ID}}
- Title: {{QUEST_TITLE}}

## Your job this turn
1) Read: game/GAME.md, game/RULES.md, game/REFEREE.md
2) Read: game/QUESTS.json and find quest {{QUEST_ID}}. Use its acceptanceCriteria as the definition of "done".
3) Implement ONLY this quest.
4) Do NOT commit. Do NOT mark the quest complete. The orchestrator will do that after referee passes.
5) Write a short turn summary to: game/turn_notes.md
   Include:
   - What you changed
   - Files touched
   - Any gotchas/patterns worth remembering

## Constraints
- Keep diffs small.
- No unrelated refactors.
- If you need to adjust tests/typecheck to satisfy the quest, do it minimally.

Begin.
